alex has two main threads: the protocol thread, and the UI thread.

When using JACK, there is another thread filling and draining ringbuffers
defined in jack_client.c.

The driving thread is the network thread. It waits for an incoming event or
times out, then processes waiting events and sends voice.

The UI thread corresponds to main() and is just like any other UI thread you've
ever seen. It waits for user input and then acts on it, e.g. by calling
IAX2Protocol::call().
